# Stat184FInalProject
# We used the BOAST style of coding
# In this Project we analyzed carbon emissions generated by various countries, sectors, and how they correlate to GDP. 
# We used 3 datasets to accomplish this analysis and we came to the conclusions that China doesn't care about Carbon Emissions, Electricity and Heat are the biggest contributors out of 
#all the sectors to CO2 emissions, and there is a positive correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions. These are all farily common talking points but it was very interesting to see how
#the data lined up and putting all the information together ourselves.
